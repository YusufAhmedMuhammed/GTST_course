## 1. What is Programming?
Programming is how we communicate with computers using languages to give them instructions.

## 2. What is a Program & Algorithm?
Program: A written version of an algorithm in a programming language.

Algorithm: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

## 3. Pseudocode
A simple, human-readable way to describe programming logic without worrying about syntax.

## 4. Evolution of Computing
From vacuum tubes to AI systems.

Programming languages evolved from Assembly to high-level languages like Python.

## 5. Types of Programming Languages
Low-Level: Close to machine (e.g., Assembly, C)

High-Level: Human-friendly (e.g., Python, Java)

Translated using compilers or interpreters

## 6. Uses of Programming
Web development, mobile apps, AI, automation, games, cybersecurity, etc.

## 7. What is Python?
A high-level, interpreted language.

Known for simplicity and wide use in AI, data science, web dev, and more.

## 8. History of Python
Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.

Influenced by ABC, C, and Modula-3.

## 9. Installing Python & IDEs
Windows: Download from python.org

Linux: sudo apt install python3

Use IDEs like VS Code, PyCharm, or PythonIDE for coding.

## 10. Python Basics
Output: print("Hello")

Comments: Add notes with #

Keywords: Special words like if, for, def (reserved)

## 11. Variables & Data Types
Variable: x = 10 (stores value)

### Data Types:

int, float, complex – Numbers

str – Text

list – Ordered, changeable: [1, 2, 3]

tuple – Ordered, unchangeable: (1, 2, 3)

dict – Key-value pairs: {"name": "GTST"}
