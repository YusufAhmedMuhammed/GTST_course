### 2. What is a Kernel?
A program that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software.

### 3. History of Linux
1969: UNIX was created (closed-source).

1991: Linus Torvalds released Linux as open-source.

GNU Project (1983) by Richard Stallman aimed to build a free OS; when combined with Linux kernel, it became GNU/Linux.

Mate

GNOME

KDE Plasma

XFCE

### 7. Window Managers
Lightweight interface to manage application windows.

Example: i3-window-manager

### 8. Why Use Linux?
Lightweight & Fast

Secure & Open-source

Preferred by developers & hackers

Powers majority of servers, smartphones, supercomputers

### 9. Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)
Debian-based: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Parrot OS

Arch-based: Garuda, BlackArch

Others: Fedora, Red Hat, Gentoo, Android

Best for hacking: Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Garuda, BlackArch

### 10. Ways to Use Linux
Main Boot: Linux as primary OS

Dual Boot: Linux + another OS (like Windows)

Live Boot: Run Linux from USB without installing

Cloud Terminal: e.g., Webminal.org

Virtual Machine: Run Linux inside Windows using software

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): Run Linux in Windows terminal

### 11. Virtualization Types
Type 1 (Bare-Metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi)

Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)
